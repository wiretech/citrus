For large scale mobile and Frontend JS aps, there is a need for order and sophistication. Citrus Provides that. For Laravel users, this package is a wrapper and a formatter for backend data to be passed as either arrays or JSON. Citrus takes Laravel object data and builds it into arrays with custom indexes. Then, it will then return the data in a standard format, that never changes so that Frontend or Mobile Developers relying on it are never confused.
